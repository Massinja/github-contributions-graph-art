# VERSION 2.0
# instead of consecutive days of commits, add code to make commits in the pattern of recognizable characters 

# GitHub contribution graph starts on Sundays, 7 squares high, ~50 squares wide;
# 5 shades of green - the colour is individual to user's activity level 

# Plan:
# -get the Sunday date from the user to start from
# -get the characters from the user from our predefined list
# the list [A-Z 0-9 heart tree smile snowflake ! ? dash]
# 

# for example:
# to display H:
# commit for 7 days
# skip 3 days, commit for 1 day, skip 3 days
# skip 3 days, commit for 1 day, skip 3 days
# commit for 7 days
 
# to make a single space between characters:
# skip 7 days
